# Animal Rights Network
The Animal Rights Network is a platform to unite the animal rights activism community and make it more accessible.

## Contribution
Every animal rights advocate with the required skills is welcome to help in the development of this awesome project. Details and development guidelines are stated in the [Contribution](/AnimalRightsNetwork/arn-webapp/wiki/Contribution) wiki page. If you would like to contribute in a way besides programming, feel free to open issues for feature requests or contact me personally :smile:

## Get the application running yourself
To get the web application running, make sure `ruby >= 2.2.2` is installed on your system.

Install rails version 5.1:
```
gem install rails -v 5.1
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnimalRightsNetwork/arn-webapp.git
cd arn-webapp
```

Checkout the branch you would like to work on and install the required gems:
```
bin/bundle install --without production
```

Create and migrate the database:
```
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Now you should be able to start the server:
```
bin/rails server
```

## Deploy the application yourself
To get the web application running, make sure `ruby >= 2.2.2` is installed on your system.

Install rails version 5.1:
```
gem install rails -v 5.1
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnimalRightsNetwork/arn-webapp.git
cd arn-webapp
```

Make sure you are on the master branch to get the the latest stabel release:
```
git checkout master
```

Replace the `unicorn-rails` and the `mysql2` gems in the `:production` group with your prefered app server and database driver.

Install the required production gems:
```
bin/bundle install --without development test
```

Setup your database.

Set up the following environment variables (for example in your `.bash_profile`):
```
export RAILS_DATABASE=<driver>://<db-user>:<db-password>@<db-ip>:<dp-port>/<db-name>
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=<secret> # Can be generated by 'bin/rails secret'
export RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true # Only if your web server is not configured to serve the static files
export RAILS_ENV=production
```

Migrate the database:
```
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Precompile the assets:
```
bin/rails assets:precompile
```

Start the application server on your desired ip address and port (by default `localhost:3000`):
```
bin/rails server --binding <ip-address> --port <port>
```
